/**
 * Recall that JavaScript is "loosely typed". This means that JavaScript does not require the developer
 * to explicitly define type. However, JavaScript still has types - Number, String, Boolean, Object, Symbol,
 * BigInt, Null, Undefined. JavaScript simply treats them all equally: when a comparison to, let's say, a Number and
 * a String happens, JavaScript will undergo implicit type coercion to temporarily turn them into equivalent data types. In that
 * case, the Number will be implicitly turned into a String just for the purpose of comparing the two.
 *
 * This lab will show off the difference between == and ===. == is an equality comparison that allows for implicit type coercion.
 * === is an equality comparison that will not allow for type coercion, so equivalent pieces of data that have different
 * datatypes will not be considered equal. Check out the two functions below. When you're done, continue to the second half
 * of the lab below to explore explicit type coercion.
 *
 * More info on type coersion here:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion

/*  OPTIONAL PRACTICE: If you want more practice later, try using the "typeof" method in JS; this operator returns

        typeof(5);

/**
 * JavaScript allows for explicit type coercion as well. This means that a developer can change the type of a variable to another
 * type if the situation calls for it. Sometimes, this can be risky if not used correctly. Other times, it can be extremely
 * beneficial. JavaScript provides built-in functions to explicitly convert variables to other types.
 *
 * The functions Number(), String(), and Boolean() can be used to explicitly convert variables to these types. Your task is to
 * use these functions to convert the provided variables to different types.
